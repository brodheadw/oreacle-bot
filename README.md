The goal of *Oreacle-bot v1.0* is to monitor the exact sources the "CATL receives license renewal for Yichun Lithium mine by x" market cites (CNINFO filings for CATL 300750, SZSE notices, and Jiangxi natural-resources notices), auto-translate Chinese items, classify them (e.g., "provisional approval allowing restart" vs "exploration only"), and post a concise, cited update as a Manifold comment-- optionally take a small, rule-based position.
